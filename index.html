          <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name (as you may have guessed by this point) is Paul Unsted. I am currently 35 years old, and self-employed. I offer freelance business administration, helping small companies tackle anything from graphic design and marketing strategies to invoicing and customer service.</p>
    
          <p>I have a score of hobbies and interests: I love videogames, films, books, beers, conversation, music (both its consumption and creation) and many other things. I have lived on Vancouver Island, in England, and visited Australia and Paris.</p>
    
          <p>It is my fervent hope that the skills that I am learning in my continuing education class will open all manner of new career options for me. I've already learned quite a bit, but the real challenge is yet to come!</p>
